Optical Character Recognition abbreviated as OCR is the electronic translation of images of handwritten, typewritten or printed text into a machine editable text. An OCR system enables you to take a book or magazine article, feed it directly into an electronic computer file, and then edit the generated text file using a word processor. Thus it can convert the printed characters on the scanned page into editable text. OCR is a field of research which comes under the area of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. OCR converts printed or handwritten scanned documents into ASCII characters that a computer can recognize.
